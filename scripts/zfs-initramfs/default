# List of additional datasets to mount after the root                    
# dataset is mounted.
#
# The init script will use the mountpoint specified in
# the 'mountpoint' property value in the dataset to
# determine where it should be mounted.
#
# This is a space separated list, and will be mounted
# in the order specified, so if one filesystem depends
# on a previous mountpoint, make sure to put them in
# the right order.
#
# NOTE: These are filesystem that are NOT located below
#       the root filesystem! Those will be mounted
#       automatically anyway.
#
# Example: If your root fs is 'rpool/ROOT/system',
#          then you do NOT need to add the following:
#            rpool/ROOT/system/usr
#            rpool/ROOT/system/home
#            rpool/ROOT/system/var
#          These will be mounted automatically.
#
# Instead, consider that your 'rpool/local' dataset mounts
# under /usr/local and 'rpool/opt' on /opt. Since they are
# not located under your root fs, they need to be put here.
