# Sould we use '-d /dev/disk/by-*' when importing pool?

# List of additional datasets to mount after the root dataset is mounted?
#
# The init script will use the mountpoint specified in the 'mountpoint'
# property value in the dataset to determine where it should be mounted.
#
# This is a space separated list, and will be mounted in the order specified,
# so if one filesystem depends on a previous mountpoint, make sure to put
# them in the right order.
#
# It is not necessary to add filesystems below the root fs here. It is
# taken care of by the initrd script automatically. These are only for
# additional filesystems needed. Such as /opt, /usr/local which is not
# located under the root fs.
# Example: If root FS is 'rpool/ROOT/rootfs', this would make sence.
