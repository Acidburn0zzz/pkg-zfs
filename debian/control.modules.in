Description: Native ZFS filesystem kernel modules for Linux
 An advanced integrated volume manager and filesystem that is designed for
 performance and data integrity. Snapshots, clones, checksums, deduplication,
 compression, and RAID redundancy are built-in features.
 .
 This package contains the compiled kernel module for _KVERS_
 .
 Includes the SPA, DMU, ZVOL, and ZPL components of ZFS.
 .
 If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to build
 your own zfs-modules. The zfs-source package has been
 provided for use with the Debian kernel-package utility to produce a
 version of zfs-module for your kernel.
